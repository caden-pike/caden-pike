##caden pike
##I like being able to figure out things which is my main reason for enjoying software development as I get to explore the backend of things i may have never known about if I didn't know about before
##I hope that by the end of this I know how to use python enough to the point where I can create a good game
##I hope I can learn how to protect myself from people trying to access my data and how to keep other safe aswell
##I enjoy playing instruments and making music as well as public speaking
